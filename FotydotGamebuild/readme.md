run the .exe file to play.

Use WASD or the arrows to move. you can shoot with left mouse click (at nothing because i didnt make anything to shoot, but i did handcraft the animation :) ).

Press space to jump and climb and stuff.

Yes, i know the ball doesnt roll, and the game is "short".

With this game as well, i didnt make a quit button so just ALT+F4 when ur done.

Have Fun!
